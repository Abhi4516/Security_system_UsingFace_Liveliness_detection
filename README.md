Developed a robust security system using machine learning techniques including Convolutional Neural Networks , Haar 
cascades, and Local Binary Patterns Histograms for face recognition and liveness detection.

Implemented CNN-based models for accurate facial recognition, ensuring high precision in identifying authorized 
individuals. Integrated Haar cascades to detect facial features and LBPH for facial feature extraction and recognition.
